    <h1 class="Heading2 Tagline">How <strong>productive</strong> are <strong>your posts?</strong></h1>
    <p>You're productive. You’ve sent 5,000 emails before you finish your low-fat-low-carb, high-fiber muffin. That budget that was due yesterday?  Did it last week. Last quarter's spending report? Bring it on. You type, you talk, you multi-task the multi-tasks until they are handoff-able, next-stepped and slam-dunked.</p>
    <p class="IconEquation"> All the while, you're uploading, commenting, tweeting and sharing. Click below to have Fairfield Inn and Suites create an infographic that pulls in your recent Facebook activity and displays where social media fits into your “get it done” lifestyle.</p>
