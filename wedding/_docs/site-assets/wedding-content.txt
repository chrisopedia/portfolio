Wedding Doc

Title: Chris & Kate
SubTitle: set a date

Brief:
	The idea behind the site would be a one page for all the information for the wedding.  We have half the family from Boston and the other half from California, so we want to cater to both sides.  Guests should be able to RSVP and/or contact us (either by form of by emails depending on design); we'll be sending out "Save The Date" cards that will point people to this site for the Registry info/links.

	How We Met (like to have)
		Kate &amp; I met in a somewhat conventional sense, at a bar, through mutual friends; yet nothing about this story is short of what you'd expect from these love-stricken kid. Chance meetings, food fights, missed opportunities, scheduling snafus, and the explosive food that ignited the passion. The tale is less of a love story and more of a page from the 80s romantic comedy playbook.

		SAMPLE
		Boston Red Sox
		The Boston Red Sox are in town for the entire week leading up to the wedding and the Sunday immediately following the wedding. From Monday, August 1st, to Thursday, August 4th, they'll be hosting the Cleveland Indians at historic Fenway Park.  Tickets are already on sale for those games <span class="Note">(<a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?pid=6904043&agency=MLB&tfl=Boston_Red_Sox-Schedule-2011_Red_Sox_Schedule-na-x0">Monday</a>, <a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?pid=6904044&agency=MLB&tfl=Boston_Red_Sox-Schedule-2011_Red_Sox_Schedule-na-x0">Tuesday</a>, <a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?pid=6904045&agency=MLB&tfl=Boston_Red_Sox-Schedule-2011_Red_Sox_Schedule-na-x0">Wednesday</a>, <a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?pid=6904046&agency=MLB&tfl=Boston_Red_Sox-Schedule-2011_Red_Sox_Schedule-na-x0">Thursday</a>)</span>. But the game of the year starts on Friday night when the rival New York Yankees (insert boos and hisses here) come to town for the 3-game weekend series.  These tickets may be hard to come by as this is one of the biggest rivalries in sports.  And given the fact the wedding is on Saturday, during the game, Sunday may be the best choice for attending.  Kate &amp; I are trying to plan for Sunday's game with a group of people.  If you're interested in attending with us, <a href="#rsvp">contact us</a> and let us know so we can get a headcount for tickets.
