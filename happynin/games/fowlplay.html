            <p>You may talk the talk, but can you squawk the squawk? Take to the skies as a pigeon flying through a grand park filled with unwitting victims! Score points the only way a pigeon knows how: by pooping on the people below! Earn huge point bonuses by building a combo and not missing a drop. Dodge the trees to stay alive and keep pooping. Only the most accurate and nimble pigeons will make it to the top of the leaderboards! And with OpenFeint integrated, you can compete with your friends and family! With something for everyone and plenty of new content to come, it's time to engage in some fowlplay!</p>
