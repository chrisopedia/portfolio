        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The art of storytelling has existed throughout history from our meager beginnings on the planet, to the current mediums that are enjoyed by the masses. Stories help us better understand others, ourselves, the greater world we live in and beyond. Parking Meter Productions is a production company committed to the art/business/profession/discipline of storytelling via film, television and the web.

        <ul>
            <li>Entertain &mdash; because all work and no play makes life DULL. Entertainment takes many forms and we aim to meet you where you're looking to escape and play.</li>
            <li>Inspire &mdash; us to do better and be better in all facets of our lives. It's the stuff that feeds the desire to dream BIG and push us to act "as if" things are all happening according to plan without fear.</li>
            <li>Move people &mdash; emotionally and "spiritually" - and sometimes both. A good story can and will stir something inside of us that makes us laugh or cry or sing or get angry or be afraid and any combination of these things, sometimes all in the same story.</li>
            <li>Educate &mdash; in terms of learning from actual facts, knowledge and/or from the experiences of others that occasionally tapping into the things that make you say, "hhmmmnn&hellip;"</li>
            <li>Reflect inwardly and outwardlyâ€“ To see life (the good, the bad and the ugly and the fascinating and the phenomenal) and appreciate their lives and the people in them. With open communication, the walls that divide, subside and fall to the wayside..</li>
