    <h3 class="Heading5a">Do You Need to File an Income Tax Return?</h3>
    <h5>IRS Requirements</h5>

    <p>*Many people will file a Federal income tax return even though the income on the return was below the filing requirement. The questions below will help you determine if you need to file a Federal Income Tax return or if you need to stop your withholding so you will not have to file an unnecessary return in the future.</p>
    <p>The Internal Revenue Service is providing this information as a part of our customer service and outreach efforts to Reduce Taxpayer Burden and Processing Costs. Changing your withholding and/or not filing Unnecessary Returns will save both you and the government time and money.</p>
    <p>Even if you do not have to file a return, you should file one to get a refund of any Federal Income Tax withheld.</p>
    <p>To determine if you need to file a Federal Income Tax return answer the following questions:</p>
    <p>Occasionally, individuals have one-time or infrequent financial transactions that may require them to file a Federal Income Tax return. Do any of the following examples apply to you?</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Did you have Federal taxes withheld from your pension and wages for this tax year and wish to get a refund back?</li>
        <li>Are you entitled to the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=150557,00.html" rel="external">Earned Income Tax Credit</a> or did you receive Advance Earned Income Credit for this tax year?</li>
        <li>Were you self-employed with earnings of more than $400.00?</li>
        <li>Did you sell your home?</li>
        <li>Will you owe any special tax on a qualified retirement plan (including an <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/index.html" rel="external">individual retirement account (IRA)</a> or <a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/index.html" rel="external" >medical savings account (MSA)</a>?</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Made excess contributions to your IRA or MSA</li>

        </ul>

        <li>Will you be subject to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html" target="_blank">Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</a>? (The tax law gives special treatment to some kinds of income and allows special deductions and credit for some kinds of expenses.)</li>

    <h5>California Requirements</h5>

    <p>*An individual must file a return if either their <a href="http://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/FileRtn/7.html#1" target="_blank">gross income</a> or their <a href="http://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/FileRtn/7.html#2" target="_blank">adjusted gross income</a> (AGI) was more than the amount defined by law. California residents must consider their total worldwide gross income to determine their filing requirement.</p>
    <p><strong>Part-Year residents</strong> must file a return if they have any income taxable by California (which includes income from all sources while a resident and California source income while a nonresident), and their income from all sources is more than the filing requirement amounts for residents.</p>
    <p><strong>Nonresidents</strong> must file a return if they have any California source income and their income from all sources is more than the filing requirement amounts for residents.</p>

    <h3 class="Heading5a">Personal Exemptions</h3>
    <p>There are two types of exemptions: personal exemptions and dependency exemptions. Each exemption reduces the income that is subject to tax by the exemption amount. For 2007, the exemption amount is $3,300. Only one exemption can be claimed per person. An exemption for a particular person cannot be claimed on more than one tax return. You are entitled to claim one exemption apiece for yourself, your spouse if married, and each dependent you can claim. If someone else (such as your parent) claims you as a dependent, you cannot take an exemption for yourself.</p>

    <h3 class="Heading5a">Standard Deductions</h3>
    <p>The standard deduction is a dollar amount that reduces the amount of income on which you are taxed. The amount of the standard deduction depends on the filing status, the age of the taxpayer and spouse, whether the taxpayer or spouse is blind, and whether the taxpayer can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return.  But you cannot take the standard deduction if you claim itemized deductions.</p>
    <p>In general, the basic standard deduction is an amount relative to each tax year and varies according to your filing status. The standard deduction of an individual who can be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return is the greater of:
    <ul>
        <li>An amount specified by law, or</li>
        <li>The individual's earned income plus a specified amount up to the basic standard deduction for his or her filing status.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>In some cases, your standard deduction can consist of two parts, the basic standard deduction and additional standard deduction amounts, for age, or blindness, or both. The additional amount is an amount specified by law and varies based on your filing status. If you file a separate return and can claim an exemption for your spouse, you will be allowed any additional amounts that apply to you or your spouse.</p>
    <p>The additional amount for age will be allowed if you are age 65 or older at the end of the tax year. You are considered to be 65 on the day before your 65th birthday.</p>
    <p>The additional amount for blindness will be allowed if you are blind on the last day of the tax year.</p>
    <p>For example, a single taxpayer who is age 65 and legally blind would be entitled to a basic standard deduction and an additional standard deduction.</p>
    <p>If you or your spouse were 65 or older or blind at the end of the year, be sure to claim the additional standard deduction amounts by checking the appropriate boxes on <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040a.pdf">Form 1040A</a> (PDF) or <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf">Form 1040</a> (PDF). The additional standard deduction amounts cannot be claimed on Form 1040EZ.</p>
    <p>Certain individuals are not entitled to the standard deduction. They are:
    <ul>
        <li>A married individual filing a separate return whose spouse itemizes deductions,</li>
        <li>An individual who was a nonresident alien or dual status alien during any part of the year, or<br />
        </li>
        <li>An individual who files a return for a period of less than 12 months due to a change in his or her annual accounting cycle.</li>
    </ul>
